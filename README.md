My fancy feature for my navbar is that I added a dropdown menu. \

The things that I added because I liked them from Dr. J's tutorial were: specialized columns similar to the way he seperated his rows to fit for different screens,
proper indenting so the code is more readable and understandable, captioned images, specifed meta commands included in the head of the program and an image that is specified to be
in a specific part of the page.
